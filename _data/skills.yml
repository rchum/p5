  #description: <p>Introduction</p><p>The evolution of Human Resource Management (HRM) theory and practice was influenced by economic and political factors in the 1980s, as noted by Rees (2014). With a wide scope that includes business policy, organizational behavior, international and intercultural management, and strategic management, HRM is a relatively new field that some organizations are still learning to fully understand and leverage. However, companies that effectively implement HRM practices can achieve flexibility, high performance, and competitive advantage, ultimately leading to increased value and profitability for the business and its shareholders.</p><p>HRM Foundation</p><p>HRM has become a global phenomenon and a recognized symbol for effective people management, as highlighted by Rees (2014). As a result, an increasing number of companies have placed greater emphasis on developing their HRM practices. The contributions of Professor Abraham Maslow and Professor Frederick Herzberg have been instrumental in shaping HRM theory and practice. Their motivational theories have been proven to increase both the quantity and quality of work in organizations. The Motivation Theory and Motivation-Hygiene Theory are widely applied in modern businesses and serve as the foundation for future HRM advancements. Any further developments in HRM are likely to build upon these models.</p><p>Theory of Motivation</p><p>According to Maslow&apos;s Hierarchy of Needs theory (Maslow 2000), human motivation is driven by five distinct levels of needs. These include physiological, safety, love and belonging, esteem, and self-actualization needs. Each level of need plays a critical role in shaping employees&apos; attitudes and motivation towards their work environment. By understanding and addressing these needs, organizations can effectively enhance employee engagement and productivity. Maslow&apos;s Hierarchy of Needs model provides valuable insights into the factors that motivate employees to achieve their goals. This model can be effectively utilized by HR departments to both attract and retain employees. For instance, an individual at the esteem level can be recognized and celebrated through public announcements or by featuring their picture on a hall of fame board. By addressing the specific needs of individuals at different stages of the hierarchy, HR departments can enhance employee satisfaction and loyalty, ultimately contributing to the long-term success of the organization.</p><img src="Maslows_Hierarchy_of_Needs.png" style="width:100%;height:100%;"></img>

  #description: <p>Motivation-Hygiene Theory</p><p>Herzberg&apos;s motivation-hygiene theory (Herzberg 1976) postulates that humans are motivated by two distinct sets of factors - satisfiers and dissatisfiers. Satisfiers, such as achievement, responsibility, and growth, contribute to employee satisfaction and motivation. Conversely, dissatisfiers, such as poor policies, low salary, and poor relationships, can negatively impact employee satisfaction and motivation. By understanding and addressing both the satisfiers and dissatisfiers in the workplace, organizations can enhance employee satisfaction, motivation, and ultimately, overall performance.</p><p><img src="Picture2.png" style="width:100%;height:100%;"></img></p><p>Herzberg&apos;s Motivation-Hygiene Theory provides valuable insights into the factors that can drive employees to achieve greater levels of productivity and output. By understanding the factors that contribute to employee satisfaction and motivation, organizations can more effectively manage their employees and maximize their potential. Research has shown that satisfied employees tend to be more engaged and productive in their work, and are more likely to produce high-quality work output. By addressing the factors that drive employee satisfaction and motivation, organizations can unlock the full potential of their workforce and achieve greater success.</p><p>Future HR</p><p>The integration of Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs and Herzberg’s Motivation-Hygiene Theory has set the groundwork for the future of HR management. In order to manage a diverse workforce, HR departments must be adaptable and conduct surveys and assessments to determine where each employee fits in the hierarchy. This allows HR to apply specific motivators or hygiene factors from Herzberg’s theory to each individual&apos;s situation. It&apos;s crucial to meet the individual&apos;s needs to attract and retain talent, regardless of whether the organization uses traditional or non-traditional pay structures. Of course, the organization must also ensure that the needs are reasonable and aligned with organizational goals. By creating a supportive work environment and fulfilling employees&apos; needs, the organization can cultivate a sense of belonging that is essential to its success.</p><p>The future of HR is shifting towards creating an employee-centric workplace rather than solely focusing on profits, as employees play a critical role in an organization&apos;s performance and revenue generation. The primary objective is to provide job satisfaction to employees so that they are more inclined to perform well. When employees are invested in their work, profits will naturally follow. Maslow&apos;s and Herzberg&apos;s theories are essential building blocks for most companies, although adjustments will need to be made based on organizational culture, technology, and industry specialization. Consequently, HR strategies will vary significantly, but they will all be grounded in these two theories.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>The correct implementation of HRM is vital for companies to attain success, flexibility, high performance, and a competitive edge. Maslow&apos;s Hierarchy of Needs and Herzberg&apos;s Motivation-Hygiene Theory are two critical theories that will shape the future of HRM. The application of these theories will assist companies in cultivating a sense of belonging among their employees, resulting in a passionate and dedicated workforce. By fostering an employee-friendly work environment and acknowledging their workers&apos; needs, companies can capitalize on the benefits provided by these theories and increase their overall performance.</p>
